## Status
— **FORGE-X COMPLETE (PENDING SENTINEL) — Phase 6.3 kill-switch and deterministic execution-halt foundation (MAJOR, FOUNDATION)**
Deterministic policy-driven halt decisions are now available to block execution/transport/settlement progression with explicit operator/system halt paths, typed contracts, auditable trace output, and a side-effect-free `evaluate()` probe path; runtime orchestration integration remains intentionally out of scope.

## COMPLETED
- **AGENTS.md roadmap rules insertion** — `## ROADMAP RULE (LOCKED)` and `## ROADMAP COMPLETION GATE` inserted at correct locations; insertion-only, no existing content modified (MINOR, FOUNDATION).
- **Phase 5.2 execution transport layer** implemented with deterministic gating for real submission vs simulated submission.
- **Phase 5.3 exchange integration boundary** implemented with deterministic real-network gates and explicit signing boundary contracts.
- **Phase 5.4 secure signing boundary** implemented with strict real-signing policy checks and abstracted key reference handling.
- **Phase 5.5 wallet-capital boundary** implemented with strict capital gating and controlled wallet access without fund transfer.
- **Phase 5.6 fund settlement boundary** implemented with strict policy-gated real settlement and deterministic single-shot transfer interface.
- **SENTINEL validation (PR #449, #451, #453, #455, #457)** completed with APPROVED verdicts for Phase 5.2–5.6 major-gated work.
- **Phase 6.1 execution ledger & read-only reconciliation** implemented with deterministic append-only in-memory ledger records and reconciliation checks.
- **Phase 6.2 persistent ledger & audit trail** implemented with append-only local-file persistence, deterministic reload, and read-only audit filtering.
- **Phase 6.3 kill-switch & execution-halt foundation** implemented with deterministic `KillSwitchController` arm/disarm/evaluate contracts, explicit operator/system halt triggers, fail-closed contract validation for pre-execution progression blocking, and side-effect-free `evaluate()` behavior.

## IN PROGRESS
- Awaiting SENTINEL validation for Phase 6.3 kill-switch & execution-halt foundation (MAJOR, FOUNDATION).

## NOT STARTED
- Full wallet lifecycle implementation (secret loading/storage/rotation).
- Portfolio management logic and multi-wallet orchestration.
- Automation/retry/batching for settlement and wallet operations.
- Reconciliation mutation/correction workflow (intentionally excluded from Phase 6.1 and Phase 6.2).

## NEXT PRIORITY
SENTINEL validation required for Phase 6.3 kill-switch & execution-halt foundation before merge.

Tier: MAJOR

## KNOWN ISSUES
- Pytest emits `PytestConfigWarning: Unknown config option: asyncio_mode` in this container.
- Phase 5.2 only supports single-order transport and intentionally excludes retry/batching/async workers.
- Phase 5.3 network path is intentionally narrow (single request, no retry, no batching, no async workers).
- Phase 5.4 introduces secure signing boundary only; wallet lifecycle and capital movement remain intentionally unimplemented.
- Phase 5.5 introduces wallet boundary and capital control layer only; no real fund movement, no portfolio logic, and no automation are implemented in this phase.
- Phase 5.6 introduces first real settlement boundary only; still single-shot with no retry, no batching, no async automation, and no portfolio lifecycle management.
- Phase 6.1 introduces in-memory execution ledger and read-only reconciliation only; no external persistence, no correction logic, and no background automation are implemented.
- Phase 6.2 introduces append-only local-file persistent ledger and audit trail query only; no mutation/correction logic, no background automation, and no external DB are implemented.
- Phase 6.3 introduces deterministic kill-switch halt state control only; runtime orchestration wiring and selective scope routing remain intentionally out of scope in this phase.
- Pytest import collection requires `PYTHONPATH=.` in this container for `projects.*` test module imports.
