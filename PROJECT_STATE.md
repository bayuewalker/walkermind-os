---

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

- Telegram live coverage fix pass (2026-04-06) normalized core callback/menu render paths but left remaining utility/control menu correctness gaps.
- Telegram full menu fix pass (2026-04-06): completed full operator-facing menu correctness coverage across home/system/status, wallet, positions, trade, pnl, performance, exposure, risk, strategy, settings, notifications, auto-trade, mode, control, market/markets, and refresh callback/edit/send paths.
- Enforced strict view isolation so Position/Market blocks render only in context-relevant menus; removed cross-menu bleed from unrelated utility/system/settings/control menus.
- Upgraded settings and utility callback menus to final renderer design language with callback/command parity in live navigation paths.
- Updated market label resolution to title/question/name-first with raw market id only as fallback reference metadata.
- Telegram menu truth fix pass (2026-04-06): separated positions vs exposure and pnl vs performance menu contracts, removed trade/wallet exposure bleed, fixed callback payload binding for active-position pnl movement, and added per-card ref dedup behavior in market/position cards.
- Confirmed previous full-menu/live-coverage passes still left menu-truth and data/view-mapping gaps that required this targeted correctness pass.
- Telegram menu structure + market scope control pass (2026-04-06): simplified root/submenu architecture to Dashboard/Portfolio/Markets/Settings/❓ Help, standardized Refresh All actions, added All Markets + category toggle + Active Scope Telegram controls, surfaced scope summary in Dashboard/Home, and wired market-scope enforcement into runtime market scanning/trading path.
- SENTINEL validation complete for `telegram-menu-structure-20260406` with score **96/100** and verdict **CONDITIONAL**.
- SENTINEL confirmed root menu structure, markets controls, dashboard scope summary, callback routing, and trading-loop scope gate behavior all pass for the target task.
- SENTINEL confirmed blocked-scope behavior prevents downstream ingest/signals when no category is active and All Markets is OFF.
- No CRITICAL blockers found for this task objective.
- Telegram scope hardening pass (2026-04-07): persisted Telegram market-scope state (`all_markets_enabled` + enabled categories + selection type) to local scope-state file and restored it on module/router re-init.
- Category inference hardening applied for weak-metadata and uncategorized markets: deterministic inference order plus fallback inclusion path under category mode to reduce avoidable exclusions while preserving blocked-scope behavior when no categories are active.
- Telegram /start numeric placeholder blocker patch (2026-04-06): hardened Telegram-facing numeric normalization in view/callback payload paths so `"N/A"`, `None`, empty, missing, and malformed numeric values no longer hard-crash dashboard/menu render.
- Telegram Home live blocker addendum (2026-04-06): hardened callback Home payload hydration against malformed shared-state payloads, unified Home↔`/start` safe numeric normalization policy, and added callback render fallback so degraded Home payloads do not hard-crash.
- Telegram live-path blocker fix (2026-04-06): removed root-menu divergence by aligning reply keyboard with 5-item root contract, forced `/start` to emit authoritative inline main menu payload, and hardened shared portfolio normalization path that could still execute `float(\"N/A\")`.
- SENTINEL validation complete for `telegram-menu-scope-hardening-20260407` with verdict **APPROVED** (score **88/100**) and **no critical issues**.
- BRIEFER handoff completed for `telegram-menu-scope-hardening-20260407`.

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Phase 10.4 — 24H Live Paper Run
- Final on-device Telegram visual confirmation in live-network environment.
- Operational follow-up monitoring for external Railway/live deployment confirmation status.
- COMMANDER merge-decision preparation based on APPROVED validation result (88/100, no critical issues) and completed BRIEFER handoff.

---

## ❌ NOT STARTED

- None.

---

## 🎯 NEXT PRIORITY

- COMMANDER merge decision for `telegram-menu-scope-hardening-20260407`.
- Continue external Railway/live confirmation monitoring as operational follow-up until fully confirmed.
- Merge to main remains a COMMANDER-only decision.

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

- `clob.polymarket.com` / external market-context endpoint was unreachable from this validation container, producing warning logs during local checks.
- Final on-device Telegram visual confirmation still requires external live-network validation because this container cannot provide full real Telegram screenshot verification.
