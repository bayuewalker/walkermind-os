## Repository Truth Snapshot

### DONE
- CrusaderBot paper beta release path (Phases 9.1, 9.2, 9.3) is completed on `main`.
- Fly runtime is verified responding on `/`, `/health`, and `/ready`.
- Paper-only execution boundary remains explicitly enforced.

### ACTIVE
- Post-launch wording cleanup for public/operator surface clarity is merged-main historical truth via PR #721 (head branch `feature/align-readme-and-refine-telegram-onboarding-2026-04-22`).
- Priority 2 combined lane from `projects/polymarket/polyquantbot/work_checklist.md`: DB, persistence, and runtime hardening baseline.

### NEXT
- Execute Priority 2 DB + persistence + runtime hardening baseline lane.

### NOT STARTED
- Live-trading authority rollout.
- Production-capital deployment authority.

## Overview

Walker AI Trading Team is a multi-agent development system led by COMMANDER. The team builds and validates trading infrastructure across multiple platforms while preserving strict safety and scope boundaries.

For CrusaderBot, the current public state is **staged and safety-gated** with managed operator posture.

---

## AI Team

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| COMMANDER | Task authority, planning, and final decision-maker |
| FORGE-X | Build/implementation execution |
| SENTINEL | Validation/audit role for MAJOR safety-impact lanes |
| BRIEFER | Reporting and communication artifact support |

## Current Public Boundary (CrusaderBot)

- Public-ready under the current staged rollout.
- Live Fly runtime responding (`/`, `/health`, `/ready`).
- Execution remains staged and safety-gated.
- Public-safe Telegram command baseline: `/start`, `/help`, `/status`, `/paper`, `/about`, `/risk_info`, `/account`, `/link`.
- Runtime/operator `/risk` remains separate from the public-safe informational command set.
- `/risk_info` is informational/public-safe; `/risk` is runtime/operator-only.
- Not live-trading ready.
- Not production-capital ready.
