## Overview

Walker AI DevTrade is a multi-agent system for building, validating, and operating algorithmic trading infrastructure across prediction markets and financial platforms. The system runs under a structured authority chain — COMMANDER orchestrates, NEXUS executes — with strict repo-truth governance and safety gates at every tier.

**Active project:** `projects/polymarket/polyquantbot` — CrusaderBot on Polymarket.

---

## Authority Chain

```
Mr. Walker  →  COMMANDER  →  NEXUS (FORGE-X / SENTINEL / BRIEFER)
```

| Role | Function |
|---|---|
| **Mr. Walker** | Owner. Final authority on scope, risk, and capital decisions. |
| **COMMANDER** | Architect and gatekeeper. Reads repo truth, routes tasks, reviews and merges PRs. |
| **FORGE-X** | Builder. Implements, patches, refactors, opens PRs. |
| **SENTINEL** | Validator. Audits MAJOR changes before merge. |
| **BRIEFER** | Reporter. Produces HTML reports and communication artifacts from validated data. |

## Source of Truth — Priority Order

| # | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` | Highest authority — overrides everything |
| 2 | `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` | Active project navigation |
| 3 | `{PROJECT_ROOT}/state/PROJECT_STATE.md` | Current operational state |
| 4 | `{PROJECT_ROOT}/state/ROADMAP.md` | Phase and milestone truth |
| 5 | `{PROJECT_ROOT}/state/work_checklist.md` | Granular task tracking |
| 6 | `reports/forge/`, `reports/sentinel/` | Build and validation evidence |

When sources conflict: `AGENTS.md` wins. Code truth wins over report wording.

---

## Validation Tiers

| Tier | Scope | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **MINOR** | Wording, docs, templates, non-runtime cleanup | COMMANDER review |
| **STANDARD** | User-facing runtime behavior outside trading core | COMMANDER review |
| **MAJOR** | Execution, risk, capital, async core, pipeline, live-trading | SENTINEL required before merge |

## Risk Constants

These values are fixed. No code or report may deviate.

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Kelly fraction (α) | `0.25` — fractional only; `1.0` is forbidden |
| Max position size | `≤ 10%` of total capital |
| Max concurrent trades | `5` |
| Daily loss limit | `−$2,000` hard stop |
| Max drawdown | `> 8%` → system halt |
| Liquidity minimum | `$10,000` orderbook depth |
| Signal deduplication | Mandatory |
| Kill switch | Mandatory and testable |
