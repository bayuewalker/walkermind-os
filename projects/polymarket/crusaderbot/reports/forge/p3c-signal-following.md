# WARP•FORGE — P3c Signal Following Strategy

Branch: `WARP/CRUSADERBOT-P3C-SIGNAL-FOLLOWING`
Validation Tier: MAJOR
Claim Level: STRATEGY SIGNAL GENERATION — scan() + evaluate_exit() over an operator-curated feed model. No execution path, no risk gate, no capital logic touched.
Validation Target: SignalFollowingStrategy implements all three BaseStrategy hooks; bootstrap_default_strategies() idempotent with both P3b + P3c strategies; migration 010 creates 3 tables (signal_feeds + signal_publications + user_signal_subscriptions) with IF NOT EXISTS guards and partial UNIQUE on active subscriptions; SignalFeedService idempotent across create_feed / publish_signal / publish_exit / subscribe / unsubscribe; signal_evaluator emits SignalCandidates strictly from DB reads (no HTTP); /signals Telegram surface gated at Tier 2 with MAX 5 active subscriptions per user; full unit suite green.
Not in Scope: P3d per-user scan loop, execution queue wiring, risk-gate integration, operator-side publishing UI, backtesting, Polymarket metadata join inside scan().
Suggested Next Step: WARP•SENTINEL MAJOR audit on this branch (audit phases 1, 3, 4, 5 most relevant — strategy plane is data-only, infra/latency phases minimal). After SENTINEL APPROVED, P3d wires SignalFollowingStrategy + CopyTradeStrategy into the user-level scan loop and execution queue.

## 1. What was built

P3c implements the operator-curated feed model behind `SignalFollowingStrategy`. Three durable tables back the surface; one service module owns the operator + user write paths; one evaluator owns the filter-and-score pipeline that turns publications into `SignalCandidate` objects; one Telegram surface lets users opt in or out at Tier 2.

- `SignalFollowingStrategy` (`name=signal_following`, `version=1.0.0`, all three risk profiles compatible) implements the BaseStrategy ABC. `scan()` delegates to `signal_evaluator.evaluate_publications_for_user`; `evaluate_exit()` queries `signal_publications` for either trigger form (originating publication retired in place via `exit_published_at`, OR a later publication on the same feed+market with `exit_signal=TRUE`). `default_tp_sl()` returns `(0.20, 0.08)`.
- Registry bootstrap is idempotent across both P3b CopyTrade + P3c SignalFollowing. `bootstrap_default_strategies()` may be called multiple times in `main.py` lifespan and from tests after `_reset_for_tests()` without raising or duplicating.
- `SignalFeedService` is the operator + user write surface. Every method is idempotent: `create_feed` returns the existing row for an existing slug rather than UPDATE-ing; `subscribe` short-circuits on already-active subscriptions and refuses past the 5-cap under a `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(user_id))`; `unsubscribe` silently no-ops on already-unsubscribed pairs. The `subscriber_count` denormalisation is maintained inside the same transaction as the subscription flip.
- `signal_evaluator` emits one `SignalCandidate` per publication that survives the filter envelope. Filtering is best-effort over the publication payload (no HTTP): `blacklisted_market_ids` is always honoured; `categories` is honoured when the payload carries category metadata, and conservative-skipped when the filter is set but the payload is silent (mirrors the P3b copy_trade behaviour); `min_liquidity` and `max_time_to_resolution_days` are not enforced because the issue spec forbids HTTP fetches inside `scan()`.
- Migration `010_signal_following.sql` adds `signal_feeds` (slug UNIQUE, status DEFAULT 'active', subscriber_count DEFAULT 0), `signal_publications` (FK signal_feeds, payload JSONB, exit_signal DEFAULT FALSE, expires_at NULLABLE, exit_published_at NULLABLE), and `user_signal_subscriptions` (FK signal_feeds + users, unsubscribed_at NULLABLE). All `IF NOT EXISTS`. Partial `UNIQUE INDEX ... WHERE unsubscribed_at IS NULL` is the dedup boundary for active subscriptions; matching partial INDEX accelerates the hot read on the strategy scan loop.
- `/signals` Telegram surface adds list / catalog / on / off subcommands plus an inline keyboard for one-tap unsubscribe. Tier 2 (`ALLOWLISTED`) gate is enforced once at the top-level dispatcher so every subcommand inherits it. Slug validator rejects anything outside the service-side `SLUG_PATTERN = ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{1,49}$` contract (2-50 ASCII lowercase chars; `_-` permitted after the first). The handler imports `SLUG_PATTERN` from `services.signal_feed` so the bot accepts exactly what `create_feed` admits — single source of truth. The 50-char ASCII cap keeps the inline-keyboard `callback_data` (`signals:off:<slug>` — 12-byte prefix) under Telegram's 64-byte ceiling. Cap surfacing is read directly from the service layer's result code.
- Markdown safety: operator-supplied `feed_name` and `description` flow through a `_escape_md` helper before reaching `ParseMode.MARKDOWN` replies (`/signals catalog` and `/signals list`). Legacy V1 metacharacters (`_ * \`` `[`, plus backslash) are escaped so a feed name like `Alpha_Beta` or a description containing `[` cannot break the entire reply. Slugs are not escaped — the `SLUG_PATTERN` regex already forbids every Markdown metacharacter, so slugs stay safe inside backtick spans.
- `evaluate_exit` re-entry safety: the lookup is anchored to the originating publication's `published_at` (or `position.opened_at`/`created_at` as fallback). Trigger (a) — origin row's `exit_published_at` set — short-circuits before any later-exit query runs; trigger (b) — `exit_signal=TRUE` row on same `feed_id`+`market_id` with `published_at > anchor` — is bounded so a stale exit row from a previous trade cycle cannot retire a fresh re-entry. With no anchor available the evaluator holds.

No execution path. No risk gate. No CLOB client. No activation guard. No HTTP fetch from inside the strategy scan.

```

The strategy plane now carries two concrete BaseStrategy implementations registered on the singleton `StrategyRegistry`. Both are idempotently bootstrapped at process startup. P3d will own the per-user scan loop, the persisted dedup ledger for emitted publications, and the wire into the existing risk gate.

## 4. What is working

- BaseStrategy contract: `SignalFollowingStrategy().default_tp_sl() == (0.20, 0.08)`. All three abstract hooks implemented; class registers cleanly via `StrategyRegistry.register(cls())`. Verified by `test_signal_following_default_tp_sl_matches_spec`, `test_signal_following_strategy_attributes`, `test_bootstrap_registers_both_strategies`.
- Registry bootstrap idempotency: a second `bootstrap_default_strategies(reg)` call on a registry that already holds both strategies adds no duplicates and does not raise. Verified by `test_bootstrap_is_idempotent_with_both_strategies`.
- scan() defensive path: an evaluator-side exception (DB down, malformed publication, etc.) returns an empty list rather than crashing the user's scan tick. Verified by `test_strategy_scan_swallows_evaluator_exception` and `test_evaluate_handles_publication_fetch_failure`.
- evaluate_exit() — both trigger forms map cleanly to the foundation `ExitDecision(should_exit=True, reason='strategy_exit', metadata={'reason': 'signal_exit_published', ...})` invariant. Hold paths covered for missing metadata, no exit row, and DB error. Verified by `test_evaluate_exit_emits_strategy_exit_when_publication_retired`, `test_evaluate_exit_emits_strategy_exit_when_separate_exit_signal`, `test_evaluate_exit_holds_when_no_exit_row_found`, `test_evaluate_exit_holds_on_db_error`, `test_evaluate_exit_holds_when_no_feed_id_in_metadata`, `test_evaluate_exit_holds_when_no_market_id`.
- Filter logic: blacklist always honoured; categories filter conservative-skips when payload silent (mirrors P3b copy_trade); default-permissive filters allow valid publications through. Verified by 6 `_passes_market_filters` parametrised tests.
- Size resolution: payload `size_usdc` capped to `available × capital_pct`, $1 floor honoured, zero-allocation and zero-balance both return 0.0 to skip. Default $10 fallback when payload omits the size. Verified by 5 `_resolve_size_usdc` tests.
- Confidence resolution: payload value clamped into `[0.0, 1.0]`; default 0.6 when missing or invalid. Verified by 4 `_resolve_confidence` tests.
- Subscription cap enforcement: `subscribe()` returns `cap_exceeded` at or above MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PER_USER (5) without issuing an INSERT; `subscribed` under the cap wraps the work in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` with `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(user_id))` as the first execute call. `subscriber_count` is incremented on subscribe, decremented (floored at 0) on unsubscribe, both inside the same transaction as the row flip. Verified by `test_subscribe_returns_cap_exceeded_at_or_above_cap`, `test_subscribe_returns_subscribed_under_cap_with_advisory_lock`, `test_unsubscribe_returns_true_and_decrements_count`.
- Service result codes: `unknown_feed` / `feed_inactive` / `exists` / `cap_exceeded` / `subscribed` all returned correctly under fixture-driven scenarios. Verified by 5 dedicated tests.
- Idempotent feed creation: re-calling `create_feed` with an existing slug returns the existing row without issuing an INSERT. Verified by `test_create_feed_returns_existing_when_slug_exists`.
- Input validation on operator surface: `publish_signal` rejects bad sides, empty market IDs, and non-UUID feed IDs; `publish_exit` rejects empty market IDs; `create_feed` rejects empty slugs. 4 dedicated tests.
- Migration 010 idempotency: every CREATE statement guarded by `IF NOT EXISTS`. Partial UNIQUE on `(user_id, feed_id) WHERE unsubscribed_at IS NULL` is the dedup boundary for active subscriptions. Path matches the runner expectation (`migrations/`, not `infra/migrations/`).
- /signals handler: Tier 2 gate enforced at dispatcher; usage hint includes the cap; slug validator rejects whitespace, single chars, and non-slug forms; on/off paths surface `cap_exceeded`/`subscribed`/`exists`/`feed_inactive`/`unknown_feed` to the user with the correct text. List view attaches the inline keyboard when the user has subscriptions. Verified by 10 handler tests + 2 keyboard shape tests.
- Test suite: 67 new tests added. `test_signal_following.py` runs in ~0.5 s on the local sandbox. No regression in the existing crusaderbot suite (the only baseline failures are pre-existing sandbox environment gaps — `web3` and `eth_account` modules not installed — which fail at import time on `test_redeem_workers.py`, `test_activation_handlers.py::test_dispatcher_routes_activation_confirm_before_setup`, `test_daily_pnl_summary.py::test_scheduler_registers_daily_pnl_summary_job`; none touch the P3c plane).

## 5. Known issues

- min_liquidity / max_time_to_resolution_days filters are not enforced for signal_following (no HTTP fetch is allowed inside `scan()`). Operators are trusted to pre-filter on liquidity + resolution distance before publishing. Documented in `signal_evaluator` module docstring; surface-area to add a Polymarket join in P3d if WARP🔹CMD wants stricter enforcement, but that is intentionally out of P3c scope.
- The strategy emits one SignalCandidate per surviving publication on every scan tick. Per-publication-per-user dedup is the responsibility of the downstream P3d scan loop (analogous to copy_trade_events for P3b); P3c does not introduce a `signal_following_events` ledger because no execution path is wired yet.
- `signal_publications.exit_signal=TRUE` rows currently store `side='YES'` as a fixed sentinel. The exit trigger is a feed+market-level event, not an outcome-token-level one, so the side value is unused on read. Acceptable as-is; if the operator wants the exit row to carry the side of the closing leg, P3d can extend the schema.
- `subscriber_count` denormalisation is updated inside the same transaction as the subscription flip, so it stays consistent under serial workloads. Two operators flipping the same feed concurrently are serialised by the per-user advisory lock on subscribe, but the feed row itself is not lock-guarded; if a future feature unlocks bulk subscription scripts, swap to an aggregate query rather than a maintained counter.

## 6. What is next

WARP•SENTINEL MAJOR audit on `WARP/CRUSADERBOT-P3C-SIGNAL-FOLLOWING`. After SENTINEL APPROVED:

- P3d implements the per-user signal scan loop that consumes both CopyTrade + SignalFollowing strategies, persists per-user dedup of emitted candidates, and wires the surviving candidates through the existing risk gate to the execution queue.
- After P3d ships and is sentinel-approved, R12 final Fly.io deployment can proceed (the last R12 lane, currently blocked on P3c + P3d + activation guard review).

Activation guards (`EXECUTION_PATH_VALIDATED`, `CAPITAL_MODE_CONFIRMED`, `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING`) remain NOT SET. P3c does not change that posture — the strategy plane is signal-generation only and never reaches the execution layer.
