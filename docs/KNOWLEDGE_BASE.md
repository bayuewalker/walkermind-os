# PART 0 — SYSTEM PRINCIPLES

## 0.1 Architecture Philosophy

DATA → SIGNAL → RISK → EXECUTION → MONITORING

- Deterministic > probabilistic behavior  
- No silent failures  
- Safety overrides profitability  
- Every decision must be explainable  

---

## 0.2 Agent Role Separation (CRITICAL)

COMMANDER:
- Planning, validation, decisions  

FORGE-X:
- System implementation  

BRIEFER:
- Prompt generation, UI, reporting  

SENTINEL:
- Testing & validation ONLY (NOT runtime risk gate)  

---

## 0.3 Runtime Risk Engine (FIXED)

LAYER 3 is NOT SENTINEL.

Correct:

LAYER 3 — RISK ENGINE (runtime)

- Enforces all trading rules  
- Blocks invalid trades  
- Executes before order submission  

SENTINEL:
→ Used ONLY for testing (on-demand)  

---
# PART 1 — CORE TRADING FORMULAS

## 1.1 Edge Detection

Expected Value:
EV = p·b − (1−p)  
p = model probability, b = decimal odds − 1  
Enter trade ONLY if EV > 0  

Market Edge:
edge = p_model − p_market  
Positive edge = opportunity exists  

Mispricing Z-Score:
S = (p_model − p_market) / σ  
Enter if S > 1.5 (strong)  
Enter if S > 2.0 (very strong)  

Momentum Score:
M = Pt − Pt-n  
Positive = upward momentum  

Bayesian Update (log-space):
log P(H|D) = log P(H) + Σ log P(Dk|H) − log Z  
Update beliefs after every new data point  

Win Probability Adjustment:
p* = p_model − bias  
Corrects systematic model overconfidence  

Log Return:
r = ln(Pt / Pt-1)  

---

## 1.2 Position Sizing

Kelly Criterion:
f = (p·b − q) / b  
p = win prob, q = 1-p, b = net odds  

⚠️ FRACTIONAL KELLY — ALWAYS USE THIS:
f_final = α · f_kelly  
α = 0.25 (default for ALL markets)  

NEVER full Kelly (α=1.0)  
NEVER full Kelly on short timeframe markets  

Value at Risk (95%):
VaR = μ − 1.645 · σ  

Conditional VaR:
CVaR = E[loss | loss > VaR]  

Volatility Scaling:
w = target_vol / realized_vol  

---

## 1.3 Risk Metrics

Max Drawdown:
MDD = (Peak − Trough) / Peak  
Block new trades if MDD > 8%  

Downside Deviation:
σ_d = √E[min(R − τ, 0)²]  

Correlation Control:
Max correlated exposure = 40% bankroll  

---

## 1.4 Performance Metrics

Sharpe Ratio:
SR = (ER − RF) / σ(R)  
Target: SR > 2.5  

Sortino Ratio:
Sortino = (ER − RF) / σ_d  
Target: Sortino > 2.0  

Profit Factor:
PF = gross_profit / gross_loss  
Target: PF > 1.5  
PF < 1.0 = losing system  

Win Rate:
WR = winning_trades / total_trades  
Target: WR > 70%  

Expectancy:
E = (WR × avg_win) − ((1−WR) × avg_loss)  

Information Ratio:
IR = (R − B) / σ(R−B)  

---

## 1.5 Arbitrage Formulas

Arb Condition:
Σ (1/odds_i) < 1 → profit exists  

Net Edge:
net_edge = gross_edge − fees − slippage  

Execute ONLY if:
- net_edge > 2%  

CEX vs Polymarket Lag:
lag_window ≈ 500ms  

---

## 1.6 Polymarket Market Cost Function

C(q) = β · ln(Σ e^(qi/2))  

β = liquidity sensitivity parameter  
Higher β → deeper liquidity  
Lower β → higher sensitivity  

Market Maker Max Loss:
L_max = β · ln(n) / P(D)  

Binary market (n=2):
L_max ≈ $55k (example)  

---

## 1.7 Quick Reference Thresholds

ENTRY CONDITIONS:
✓ EV > 0  
✓ edge > 0  
✓ S > 1.5  
✓ net_edge > 2%  
✓ liquidity > $10,000  

POSITION RULES:
✓ Kelly α = 0.25  
✓ Max position = 10% bankroll  
✓ Max concurrent = 5  
✓ Correlation ≤ 40%  

RISK LIMITS:
✓ Daily loss = −$2000  
✓ Max drawdown = 8%  
✓ PF ≥ 1.5  

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
✓ Win Rate > 70%  
✓ Sharpe > 2.5  
✓ Profit Factor > 1.5

# PART 3 — PREDICTION MARKET INTELLIGENCE API

Base URL: https://narrative.agent.heisenberg.so  
Endpoint: POST /api/v2/semantic/retrieve/parameterized  

---

## 3.1 Universal Request Format

{
  "agent_id": <number>,
  "params": { ... },
  "pagination": { "limit": 50, "offset": 0 },
  "formatter_config": {
    "format_type": "raw"
  }
}

584 → 581 → 556 → 575 → 585  

Purpose:
- Find profitable traders  
- Validate behavior  
- Replicate trades  

---

CROSS-EXCHANGE ARBITRAGE:
565 → 574 → 573 + 556 → 575

END OF PART 3 — API SYSTEM

# PART 4 — PICO FRAMEWORK
Solo Operator System for Low-Capital Trading ($100–$500)

---

## 4.1 Overview

PICO = modular pipeline optimized for:
- Low capital
- Limited trades
- High efficiency

Core modules:

1. Market Selection  
2. Entry / Exit Logic  
3. Position Sizing  
4. Risk Controls  
5. Paper Trading  
6. Observability  

---

## 4.2 Market Selection

Liquidity Score L_m(t) ∈ [0,1]

Increases with:
- Orderbook depth  
- Recent volume  

Decreases with:
- Bid-ask spread  
- Time-to-event risk  

Feature vector φ_m(t):

- δ_m(t) → spread  
- D_m(t) → depth  
- τ_m(t) → turnover  
- evt_m(t) → time to event  
- σ_m(t) → volatility  

Selection rule:
→ pick top-K markets based on liquidity-adjusted signal  

---

## 4.3 Position Sizing (PICO)

Max stake per market:

w_m(t) ≤ min(E_m × B(t), b_max)

Where:
- E_m = 2%–4% bankroll  
- B(t) = current bankroll  
- b_max = hard cap  

---

Risk constraint:

w_m(t) ≤ max_loss_m / max(p_m, 1−p_m)

Where:
- max_loss_m = α × B(t)  
- α = 0.02–0.05  

---

## 4.4 Cooldown & Anti-Overtrading

Cooldown τ_m after position close  

Rules:
- Market only tradable if cooldown expired  
- Max trades/day = 2  
- Decision frequency = 1–6 hours  

---

Optional model (advanced):

2-layer predictor:
- Input: φ_m(t)  
- Output: cooldown scalar  

Range:
c_m(t) ∈ [0, C_max]

---

## 4.5 Stop-Loss & Take-Profit

Stop-loss:
Exit if PnL < −θ_loss  

Take-profit:
Exit if PnL > θ_profit  

Guideline:
- θ_loss = small fraction of position  
- θ_profit = multiple of θ_loss  

---

## 4.6 Cost Model

PnL_realized = payout − fees − slippage − settlement  

Components:

- Fee: 0–2%  
- Slippage: liquidity dependent  
- Settlement delay  

---

## 4.7 Hyperparameters

Exposure cap: 2–4%  
Max trades/day: 2  
Decision interval: 1–6h  
Fees: 0–2%  

Evaluation:
- 60-day window  
- Multiple walk-forward folds  
- 3 random seeds  

---

## 4.8 Observability Checklist

Monitor:

- Liquidity per market  
- Exposure  
- Cooldown state  
- Drawdown  
- Daily PnL  
- Win rate (rolling 20 trades)  
- Slippage vs expected  

---

## 4.9 Walk-Forward Validation

W_train → optimize parameters  
W_eval → test performance  

Rules:
- No data leakage  
- Separate regimes  

Compare:
- FixCD  
- RandEntr  
- Heuristic  
- PICO
